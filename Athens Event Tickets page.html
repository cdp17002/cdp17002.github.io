      <p>Our Mission</p>
      <p>We are a company that operates to make out customers satisfied. In our short run so far has proved us to be nothing but reliable. Unlike other ticket websites, we offer tickets for games, concerts, festivals, tours, plays, and other events all around Athens from right here on our website. What is Athens known for? Well it's a college town that consists primarily of students. What we offer is "College Student Budget Friendly" prices and plenty of websites exist that help people get tickets, but we offer insight to where you can find the cheapest ones. Our idea turned into a startup business and our startup business has so far taken off in a way that we never expected. We thank you for all your help and support! </p>

      <h5>Overview</h5>
      
      <p> As myself, Carter Penzien and a few fellow classmates were brainstorming for our senior project we thought of the idea of this website that we shortly after put the idea into action. As difficult and tidious as it sounded at the start of our journey, we have been fortunate enough to receive some tremendous help from sponsors, friends, professors and techs. The best way to look at our website is this, a lot of people googling lets say tickets for a specific UGA football game and get hundreds and hundreds of results that stress them out when their just trying to find the cheapest tickets available. Visiting our website, will compile all ticket websites, anyone selling tickets via social media, and any other platforms all into one site. That way you can come and get tickets quick without the going through the hassle of searching the web for hours trying to find something cheaper. Our online ticket guide is simple, simple click on what you would like to get tickets for and follow the steps. We are happy you chose to ticket with AET and are more than willing to help with any further questions.   </p>
